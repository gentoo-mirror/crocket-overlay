    Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system.
    Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.
    When mutable state is needed, Clojure offers a software transactional memory system and reactive Agent system that ensure
    clean, correct, multithreaded designs.
