    Janet is a functional and imperative programming language and bytecode interpreter. It is a modern lisp, but lists are replaced by other data structures with better utility and performance (arrays, tables, structs, tuples). The language also supports bridging to native code written in C, meta-programming with macros, and bytecode assembly.

    Janet makes a good system scripting language, or a language to embed in other programs. Think Lua or Guile.
